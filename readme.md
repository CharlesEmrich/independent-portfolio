### Description
This is an initial draft of a portfolio website, assembled in an afternoon as a test of my html, css, and bootstrap knowledge. It is also a gesture in the direction of a fully responsive website, with the majority of content controlled by css in such a way as to remain legible and good-looking across viewport sizes.
